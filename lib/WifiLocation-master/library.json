This library implements call to Google Maps GeoLocation API to get location from surrounding WiFi networks. It is not needed to know WiFi password of all of them. Internet connection is required. You need an API key from Google Maps. Check https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/intro to learn how to get your own key. After version 1.3.0 it includes getting address from location using Bing Maps API. Check https://www.bingmapsportal.com to get an API key.",
